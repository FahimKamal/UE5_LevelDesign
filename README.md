## 🎓 Project Context & Motivation

This project, **"Level Design Prototypes,"** is being developed by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as the capstone assignment for **Module 4: Greyboxing in Unreal Engine** of the **[Fundamentals of Level Design with Unreal Engine](https://www.coursera.org/learn/level-design?specialization=epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate)** course. This is the third course in the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera.

The primary goal is to translate conceptual level sketches and Level Design Documents (LDDs) into **two distinct playable greybox environments** within Unreal Engine 5.5.1:
1.  A **Single-Player (SP) Level**
2.  A **Multiplayer (MP) Level**

The focus is on core level design principles such as player flow, scale, sightlines, balance (for MP), and spatial composition, all before any artistic detailing. This repository will document the development process for both levels from initial blockout to functional greyboxes.

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Level Design Prototypes** encompasses the creation of two distinct levels being greyboxed in **Unreal Engine 5.5.1**:

*   **Single-Player Level:** A level designed to [**BRIEFLY MENTION THE CORE CONCEPT/GOAL OF YOUR SP LEVEL, e.g., "guide a solo player through a narrative-driven sequence of challenges," or "offer an exploration-focused experience with hidden areas."**].
*   **Multiplayer Level:** A level designed for [**BRIEFLY MENTION THE CORE CONCEPT/GOAL OF YOUR MP LEVEL AND PLAYER COUNT/MODE IF DECIDED, e.g., "a 2v2 symmetrical arena focusing on tactical combat," or "an asymmetrical objective-based map for 4 players."**].

The focus for both is purely on spatial design, establishing the fundamental gameplay experience through geometry, and applying level design theories and greyboxing techniques learned in the Coursera course.

---

## ✨ Key Goals & Features (Planned & In-Progress for Both Levels)

*   🧱 **Effective Greyboxing:** Create clear and functional level layouts for both SP and MP scenarios using basic geometric shapes.
*   🚶‍♂️ **Player Path & Flow (SP):** Establish a discernible critical path and intuitive navigation for the single-player experience.
*   🔄 **Map Flow & Balance (MP):** Design routes, chokepoints, and open areas suitable for multiplayer interactions, considering balance and fairness.
*   🏞️ **Spatial Definition:** Define key areas, points of interest (POIs), objectives, and transition spaces relevant to each level type.
*   📐 **Scale & Proportion:** Ensure all elements are appropriately scaled for player characters and game mechanics in both contexts.
*   👁️ **Sightlines & Composition:** Strategically plan sightlines for player guidance (SP) and tactical opportunities/cover (MP).
*   🛡️ **Gameplay Element Prototyping:** Block out areas for potential cover, encounter spaces, objectives, spawn points, or simple interactive elements as per LDDs.
*   📄 **LDD Adherence:** Translate the intentions and specifications from the Level Design Documents for both levels into 3D greyboxes.
*   💡 **Readability:** Use basic lighting and contrasting forms to ensure levels are understandable and navigable.
*   🔄 **Iterative Design & Playtesting:** Continuously playtest (solo for SP, simulated or actual for MP if possible) and refine the greyboxes.
*   📦 **Course Submission Package:** Prepare all necessary materials for the Coursera module submission, showcasing both level designs.
